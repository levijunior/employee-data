Allow mixed content in Google Chrome

2- In the pop-up window, click "Load anyway" or "Load unsafe script".

If you want to set your Chrome browser to ALWAYS(in all webpages) allow mixed content:

1- Close Chrome. Chrome must be fully closed before the next steps.

2- Right-click the Google Chrome desktop icon (or Start Menu link). Select Properties.

3- At the end of the existing information in the Target field, add: " --allow-running-insecure-content" (There is a space before the first dash.)

4- Click OK.

5- Open Chrome and try to launch the content that was blocked earlier. It should work now.

This is just workaround and you need to solve by securing both app and rest api.
